      If you are using or plan to use Braze for customer campaigns, Brightcove can help to improve this effort. Brightcove provides exports of hashed subscriber IDs that include important context about the user's experience. With the ID, Brightcove appends fields from our customer data platform that leverage our harmonization of subscriber data,  content metadata, visit & viewing analytics, and 3rd party app store data. This data enables specific targeting based on engagement frequency, intensity, content consumed, devices used, etc.
