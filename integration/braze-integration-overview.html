    <p>With this integration, you can automatically sync user records from Audience Insights directly into Braze. With every hashed user ID, Brightcove includes information about tenure, subscription plan, content consumed, devices used, geography of views, engagement status, and more. </p>
    <p>In addition, it's easy to segment users by user attributes like tenure, engagement status, viewing frequency, and content consumption. Segment tags are appended to each user record that matches the segment's criteria. These can be used for performing more targeted automated or ad hoc campaigns.</p>
