  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retention</strong> - Retention Rate uses observed churn for customers who joined the service in the last 13 months; this ensures that the retention rate is based on your service as it exists recently and is long enough to capture annual renewals and churn</li>
    <li><strong>Survival</strong> - Survival Curve is derived from the Retention Rate and projects the retention for tenures up to 1000 days (143 weeks) for use in projecting subscription lifetime value; outsized differences in the Survival and Retention lines indicate irregularities or notable events in customer churn</li>
  </ul>
