  <p>The <strong>Content Trends</strong> section of Insights provides several different ways to see trends in your content library, detailed below.</p>
  <h3>Popular content</h3>
  <p>In the <strong>Popular Content</strong> graph, you can see a ranking of your titles by hours viewed or the number of engaged views (at least 30 seconds). Note that you can mouseover a title in the <strong>Legend</strong> to highlight its line in the graph, and also adjust the date range and granularity:</p>

  <p>Below the Content Trends graph are some data points for you overall content library:</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Note that you can drag the mouse over these to see data for each day.</p>
  <p>The relevance of these will likely vary somewhat depending on the kind of content you have, but Attention Index is one probably everyone will find useful. It ranges from -100 to 100, comparing the number of "dissatisfied viewers" (who watched at least one minute but less than 10% of a video) with "satisfied viewers" (who watched at least 75%). Negative numbers mean you have more unsatisfied than satisfied viewers.</p>
  <h3>Top content</h3>
  <p>You can see details about audience size, engaged views, completion rate, and so forth for all your content in this section of Insights:</p>

  <p>Click on any column to sort the content list by that column.</p>
  <h3>Library Breakdown and First Watched</h3>
  <p>The last two parts of Insights offer you information on the performance by type (short clips vs. full videos) and on videos watched for the first time in this period:</p>
