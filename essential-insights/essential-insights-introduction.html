  <p>Insights is designed as an informational tool, answering two questions every video service has: how is my audience engaging with my video service and how is my content performing. Unique features include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Engaged Views</strong> (as defined as at least 30 seconds). Engaged views are a better indication of how your content is working than video views - because as we know, there are a lot of 5-second views that are accidental or a result of random curiosity and do not reflect your real audience.</li>
      <li>Beyond understanding the Total Hours Viewed per Device, a breakdown by <strong>User</strong> identifies particular devices that are over or under performing.</li>
      <li><strong>Sessions Over Time</strong> not only gives a sense of how many audience members are engaging with your video service but the average duration of their session. Any time session duration drops, you should start digging into your content performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Percent Library Viewed</strong> and <strong>Percent Viewers Watching New Content</strong> (released in the last two weeks) are distinct metrics indicating your library's performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Attention Index</strong> is a better method for measuring how engaging any video, series, or genre is.  The percentage of viewers that complete less than 10% of a video are subtracted from the percent of viewers watching more than 75% of a video. Itâ€™s like a Net Promoter Score for video.</li>
      <li><strong>Top Titles includes Play Starts</strong> and <strong>Engaged Views</strong> as well as the <strong>Attention Index</strong> help you understand how each video is working for your audience. Editorial and promotional decisions should steer audiences to the most compelling videos.</li>
      <li><strong>First Watched</strong> identifies the first video an audience member engages with, including its <strong>Attention Index</strong>. Promoting the right group of videos is a key to attracting new audience members.</li>
      <li>CSV Exports allow for additional analysis and can support Royalty Reporting or importing into personalization engines.</li>
    </ul>
